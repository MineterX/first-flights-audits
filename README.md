# 🛡️ Web3 Smart Contract Audit Portfolio

This repository contains a collection of test audits, exercises, and security analyses of smart contracts.  
They are not production audits — instead, they serve as a personal archive to:

- 📌 Track my progress in Web3 security
- 🧠 Practice auditing techniques
- 🔍 Explore real and simulated vulnerabilities
- 🧪 Experiment with fuzzing, Foundry testing, and security patterns

## 🧰 Tools & Stack
- **Solidity**
- **Foundry**
- **Forge tests** + Fuzzing
- **Manual analysis & CTF logic**

## 🚧 Status
This is a _learning-focused_ repository. Most reports are created as part of:
- Audit training courses (e.g., Cyfrin Updraft)
- Self-driven contract reviews
- CTF challenges and test protocols
